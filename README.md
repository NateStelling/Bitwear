# Bitwear
Cartesi Hackathon Submission

Bitwear is an online fashion marketplace that sells NFT digital clothing for the metaverse. Anyone can upload and sell unique designs. Stand out in the virtual world today!

Our inspiration came from our team's love for fashion and our interest in the blockchain community.

At the Bitwear marketplace, you'll find a vast collection of digital clothing items, ranging from stylish dresses and trendy tops to flashy accessories and statement pieces. Each piece is unique, and since they're NFTs, you'll own a unique copy of the item.

Selling on our platform is easy. All you need to do is create an account, upload your digital clothing designs, and set your prices. Once uploaded, your items will be available for purchase to a global audience of metaverse enthusiasts.

Not only is our marketplace a great place to sell your digital clothing designs, but it's also an excellent place to discover new styles and trends. Our user-friendly search function allows you to find specific items or browse by category, so you're sure to find something that suits your style.

We built our demo using Axure and used Cartesi to mint NFTs to the blockchain.

The main challenges we ran into were the actual minting with Cartesi as we were not expert coders. In the future we would like to finish the NFT minting and exchange functionalities.

Our team is very proud of the demo, business pitch, and PowerPoint that we developed, and we are thankful to Cartesi for providing us with such a great learning opportunity.
