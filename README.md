# Bitwear
Cartesi Hackathon Submission

Bitwea is an online fashion marketplace that sells NFT digital clothing for the metaverse. Anyone can upload and sell unique designs. Stand out in the virtual world today!

Our inspiration came from our team's love for fashion and our interest in the blockchain community.

At the Bitwear marketplace, you'll find a vast collection of digital clothing items, ranging from stylish dresses and trendy tops to flashy accessories and statement pieces. Each piece is unique, and since they're NFTs, you'll own a unique copy of the item.

Selling on our platform is easy. All you need to do is create an account, upload your digital clothing designs, and set your prices. Once uploaded, your items will be available for purchase to a global audience of metaverse enthusiasts.

Not only is our marketplace a great place to sell your digital clothing designs, but it's also an excellent place to discover new styles and trends. Our user-friendly search function allows you to find specific items or browse by category, so you're sure to find something that suits your style.

We built our demo using Axure and Cartesi to mint nfts to the blockchain.

The main challenges we ran into were the actual minting with Cartesi as we were not expert coders.

We are super proud that we built a demo, made a pitch and PowerPoint, and minted our first nft!

We learned more about the blockchain community and how to mint nfts using Cartesi!

We hope to fully pursue Bitwear and develop it into an actual space for metaverse influencers to sell and share their creations! :)
